# Maze Solver Game in C++
This is a maze solver game implemented in C++. 
The game generates a maze using Kruskal's algorithm, creates a player, and allows the player to 
navigate through the maze. The player's goal is to reach the finish cell at the end of the maze. 
The program uses a graphical library (not provided) for rendering and user interaction.

## Features
Randomly generates a maze using Kruskal's algorithm.
Implements a player that can move through the maze.
Supports two search algorithms for solving the maze: 
Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
Displays the explored and shortest path while solving the maze.
Provides an option to toggle the display of the player's path.
Offers a reset option to restart the maze-solving process.
## How to Use
Clone this repository.
Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler.
Interact with the game using keyboard inputs to move the player and trigger specific actions.
Choose between DFS and BFS algorithms to solve the maze.
Toggle the display of the player's path on/off.
Restart the maze-solving process by pressing the 'r' key.
Please note that this program depends on a graphical library for rendering and user interaction. 
You need to integrate the graphical library of your choice to run the 
game and see the visual effects.
